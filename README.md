# PlaywrightDemos

This repos contains some Playwright C# democode which I'm using to showcase "Playwright" on software developer conference talks.

# Scenarios:
- Simple smoke test (open website, click, check result)
- Datadrive smoke test
- Download a file and check if file exists
- Locate elements
- Intercept network calls
- Debugging 
  - Record a video / screenshot
  - Tracing
